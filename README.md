# hello-world
I am in the process of learning python, and this file will contain the records of that learning experience.
  My background is in biological research, which incorporated a fair amount of data analysis (using R, Graphpad Prism, and Excel).
  Now, I am looking to make a full-fledged transition into the field of Data Analysis!
